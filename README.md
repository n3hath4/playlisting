# Playlisting.uk 🎵 (In Development)

A community-driven music discovery platform bringing the gap between physical media curation and algorithmic recommendations.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Playlisting creates a space where music lovers can discover new artists through community recommendations rather than algorithms. Users can explore genre-based discussion forums, share discoveries, and curate personal playlists informed by genuine human taste.

**The Problem:** Streaming algorithms create echo chambers. Physical collections offer curation but lack discovery tools.

**The Solution:** Community-driven discovery forums organised by genre, where users share artists, songs, and albums - creating a treasure trove of authentic recommendations.

## 🚧 Current Status

**Completed:**
- Project structure and HTML layouts (Will tailor colouring and positioning final stage)
- Route planning and framework setup

**In Progress:**
- Genre-based discussion forums
- Playlist curation features
- User authentication and profile system

**Planned:** 
- Music metadata integration
- Advanced search and filtering
- Community interaction features (likes, comments)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Flask, Jinja2
- **Database:** MySQL (development) / PostgreSQL (production)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Deployment:** Planned for playlisting.uk

## 📚 Learning Journey

This project serves as my CS50 Final Project. While I've completed CS50 Finance and draw inspiration from its authentication patterns and route structures, Playlisting represents a significant expansion into:
- Community forum architecture
- Music data handling and curation
- User-generated content management
- Production deployment workflows 

## 🙏 Attribution

User authentication patterns (login_required decorator, error handling) adapted from CS50 Finance problem set and extended for music platform functionality.
